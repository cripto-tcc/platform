## 🤖 Project Overview

This project is a **Web3 conversational chatbot** designed to enable cryptocurrency operations through **natural language interactions**.  
Instead of interacting directly with complex interfaces, users can perform blockchain actions by simply typing commands in natural language.

The chatbot supports core crypto operations such as:
- **Token swaps**
- **Crypto transfers**
- **Price quotations and market checks**

By integrating **Phantom Wallet** for user authorization and **Firebase** for session and state management, the platform combines the usability of conversational interfaces with the security of Web3 authentication.

This approach lowers the barrier to entry for blockchain interactions, making crypto operations more accessible, intuitive, and user-friendly.
